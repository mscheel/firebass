Hi,

I’m currently busy trying to locate a missing fish. Could you help? It was last seen at firebase.foo. I might be able to give you an I/O 2017 ticket if you help me find it.

Sincerely,

Alex

### Call

If you call the following number (415) 799-1261, you get a google voice number of a robo-googler. He says he lost his fish and your efforts will be in vain. Then he puts you on hold with some robo music.
